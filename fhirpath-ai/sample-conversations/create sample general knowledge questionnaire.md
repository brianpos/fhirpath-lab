**FhirPath AI** *(gpt-4o-2024-08-06)* **:**
 To create a new questionnaire in FHIR, we need to define the basic structure including metadata and items that specify each question. Below is an example structure for a FHIR Questionnaire resource. You'll need to specify the questions you'd like to include, but I’ll provide a general template to get you started:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Questionnaire",
  "id": "example-questionnaire",
  "status": "draft",
  "subjectType": ["Patient"],
  "title": "Example Questionnaire",
  "item": [
    {
      "linkId": "1",
      "text": "First question text here",
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "linkId": "2",
      "text": "Second question text here",
      "type": "boolean"
    },
    {
      "linkId": "3",
      "text": "Third question text here",
      "type": "decimal"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Parts of a Questionnaire:

- **`resourceType`**: This will always be `"Questionnaire"` for questionnaire resources.
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the resource.
- **`status`**: The current status of the questionnaire (e.g., `"draft"`, `"active"`, `"retired"`, `"unknown"`).
- **`subjectType`**: The resource type(s) that responses are expected to be associated with, commonly `"Patient"`.
- **`title`**: A human-readable name for the questionnaire.
- **`item`**: An array of questions or groups in the questionnaire.

### Questions:
Each question is defined as an object with at least a `linkId`, `text`, and a `type`. Depending on your needs, you might also require attributes like `required`, `repeats`, or `initial`.

- **`linkId`**: A unique identifier within the questionnaire for each question.
- **`text`**: The actual question text displayed to users.
- **`type`**: The type of answer expected (`string`, `boolean`, `integer`, `decimal`, `date`, `choice`, etc.).

Please provide the specific questions and types you wish to include, and I’ll help you further refine the questionnaire!

This `QuestionnaireResponse` is linked to the previously defined `Questionnaire` using its `questionnaire` field. The answers provided are sample responses; you can customize them based on actual data or context. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to adjust!

**Author:**
 That's awesome! I'm working on a proposal to include a QR like this as an "answer key" for the questionnaire which proposes to add an extension ("http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-item-answerAssessment" of type markdown) into each of the answers which explains why the answer is correct (in markdown format)

**FhirPath AI** *(gpt-4o-2024-08-06)* **:**
 That's a great idea! Adding explanations for each answer in markdown format enhances the educational value of the questionnaire. For your proposal, you can use the provided extension URL for answer assessment within the `QuestionnaireResponse` resource. 

Here's how you might structure a sample `QuestionnaireResponse` with the proposed extension for the first few questions to illustrate how this would look:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "QuestionnaireResponse",
  "id": "trivia-response-answer-key",
  "questionnaire": "Questionnaire/trivia-questionnaire",
  "status": "completed",
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/example"
  },
  "item": [
    {
      "linkId": "1",
      "answer": [
        {
          "valueString": "Yolk",
          "extension": [
            {
              "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-item-answerAssessment",
              "valueMarkdown": "The **yolk** is the yellow part of an egg, which serves as the nutrient-rich food store for the developing embryo."
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "linkId": "2",
      "answer": [
        {
          "valueInteger": 6,
          "extension": [
            {
              "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-item-answerAssessment",
              "valueMarkdown": "Most **insects** have six legs, with three pairs attached to their thorax, making them distinct from arachnids, which have eight."
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "linkId": "3",
      "answer": [
        {
          "valueString": "Joey",
          "extension": [
            {
              "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-item-answerAssessment",
              "valueMarkdown": "A baby kangaroo is called a **joey**. They are born very underdeveloped and continue to grow in their mother's pouch."
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of the Structure:
- **Extension URL**: The `url` is set to `"http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-item-answerAssessment"`, as per your proposal.
- **Value**: `valueMarkdown` is used to hold a markdown-formatted explanation of the answer.
  
This format will allow each answer to have an associated explanation in markdown, providing a clear rationale for each correct answer. Do you want me to continue this pattern for the rest of the questions, or is there any further customization you’d like to make?

**Author:**
 That's right, can you do that for all the questions please?

Each question is followed by its answer with an explanation in markdown format using the desired extension. This format can serve as an informative "answer key" for your questionnaire. If there are any other details you need, feel free to ask!

**Author:**
 Can you also elaborate in the text on each and include some other answers that could potentially be correct, or others that could be commonly mistaken as the answer and why they aren't.

**FhirPath AI** *(gpt-4o-2024-08-06)* **:**
 Certainly! Let me enhance the explanations to include other potential answers and common misconceptions for each question. This approach gives more depth to the explanations and can be very educational.
