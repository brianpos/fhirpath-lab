 To create a new questionnaire in FHIR, we need to define the basic structure including metadata and items that specify each question. Below is an example structure for a FHIR Questionnaire resource. You'll need to specify the questions you'd like to include, but I’ll provide a general template to get you started:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Questionnaire",
  "id": "example-questionnaire",
  "status": "draft",
  "subjectType": ["Patient"],
  "title": "Example Questionnaire",
  "item": [
    {
      "linkId": "1",
      "text": "First question text here",
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "linkId": "2",
      "text": "Second question text here",
      "type": "boolean"
    },
    {
      "linkId": "3",
      "text": "Third question text here",
      "type": "decimal"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Parts of a Questionnaire:

- **`resourceType`**: This will always be `"Questionnaire"` for questionnaire resources.
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the resource.
- **`status`**: The current status of the questionnaire (e.g., `"draft"`, `"active"`, `"retired"`, `"unknown"`).
- **`subjectType`**: The resource type(s) that responses are expected to be associated with, commonly `"Patient"`.
- **`title`**: A human-readable name for the questionnaire.
- **`item`**: An array of questions or groups in the questionnaire.

### Questions:
Each question is defined as an object with at least a `linkId`, `text`, and a `type`. Depending on your needs, you might also require attributes like `required`, `repeats`, or `initial`.

- **`linkId`**: A unique identifier within the questionnaire for each question.
- **`text`**: The actual question text displayed to users.
- **`type`**: The type of answer expected (`string`, `boolean`, `integer`, `decimal`, `date`, `choice`, etc.).

Please provide the specific questions and types you wish to include, and I’ll help you further refine the questionnaire!
